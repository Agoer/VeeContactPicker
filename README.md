VeeContactPicker is an objc replacement for the bugged ABPeoplePickerNavigationController (see [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30372190/is-abpeoplepickernavigationcontroller-slow)). It lets you choose a contact from the address book.

### Features

- Load contacts very fast! Not like the iOS official controller...
- Search contacts also by email addresses or phone numbers!
- Retro compatible with iOS 7
- Handle contacts selection with completion block or delegation
- Choose which contacts you want to show in the picker (e.g only contacts with a valid email address)
- Easy customizable apperance, without needing to subclass it. See "How to use it - Details"
- Good test coverage
