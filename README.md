- Search contacts also for email addresses or phone numbers!
- Easy customizable apperance, without subclassing or changing the code
- Choose which contacts you want to show in the picker (for example only contacts with a valid email address)
- Handle contacts selection with completion block or delegation
- Good test coverage
